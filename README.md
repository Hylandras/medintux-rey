# MedintuxGP
Originally this work started as a private glossary an some provements for a GP willing to change its software for MedinTux, but during the development it appeared that the hours spent could serve several other GPs.
So this repository was created to serve as a development tool for the original recipient but is maintained as well as we have the time for. So when this work will be reliable we could propose our work to the MedinTux community or if it's to specialized, we could keep it as a fork.

Initially the work has to be done with macro development, glossary impovement, before to attack binary source code.
Ideally, if we can avoid to change binaries before the version 3 we will, because even if the backward compatibility is guaranteed the change from qt3 to qt5 means great alterations to the source code...
